# Basic Principles of Elliptic Curve Cryptography

Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is a public key cryptographic system that uses the algebraic structure of points on an elliptic curve over a finite field. Although elliptic curves appear geometric, cryptographic security arises from the group properties of these points and the difficulty of reversing certain operations defined on them.

## 1. Elliptic Curve as a Mathematical Group

An elliptic curve defined over a finite field consists of a finite set of points along with a special point called the **point at infinity**, denoted by \( \mathcal{O} \).

Under a defined operation called **point addition**, the points on an elliptic curve satisfy the following group properties:

- Closure  
- Associativity  
- Identity element (\( \mathcal{O} \))  
- Inverse element  

Hence, the set of points on an elliptic curve forms an **abelian group**.

---

## 2. Scalar Multiplication and Subgroup Formation

Given a point \( P \) on the elliptic curve, repeated addition of \( P \) to itself produces new points:

\[
P,\; 2P,\; 3P,\; 4P,\; \dots
\]

This operation is called **scalar multiplication**, where:

\[
kP = \underbrace{P + P + \dots + P}_{k\ \text{times}}
\]

The set of points obtained by scalar multiplication of \( P \) forms a **cyclic subgroup** generated by \( P \).

---

## 3. Order of a Point

The **order of a point \( P \)** is defined as the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that:

\[
nP = \mathcal{O}
\]

If a point \( P \) has order \( n \), then the subgroup generated by \( P \) is:

\[
\langle P \rangle = \{ P,\; 2P,\; 3P,\; \dots,\; (n-1)P,\; \mathcal{O} \}
\]

Important properties:

- The points \( P, 2P, \dots, (n-1)P \) are all **distinct**
- These points represent **all non-identity elements** of the subgroup
- The subgroup contains exactly \( n \) elements
- Scalar multiplication cycles back to the identity element after \( n \) additions

Thus, scalar multiplication by integers from \( 1 \) to \( n-1 \) generates all members of the subgroup.

---

## 4. Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP)

Consider the scalar multiplication equation:

\[
Q = kP
\]

- Given \( P \) and \( k \), computing \( Q \) is **computationally easy**
- Given \( P \) and \( Q \), finding \( k \) is **computationally infeasible**

This problem is known as the **Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP)**.

Even if we are given a point such as \( Q = 3P \) or \( Q = 4P \), determining the scalar value that produced the point is infeasible when the subgroup order is very large.

The hardness of ECDLP forms the **security foundation of ECC**.

## 5. Elliptic Curve Encryption and Decryption (Conceptual Explanation)

Elliptic curve encryption hides a message by combining it with a secret scalar multiple of a public key point.

### 5.1 Key Generation (Receiver Side)

The receiver performs the following steps:

- Chooses a private key \( d \)
- Computes the public key:
\[
Q = dP
\]

Here:
- \( d \) is kept secret
- \( Q \) is made public

---

### 5.2 Encryption (Sender Side)

Assume the message is represented as a point \( M \) on the curve.

The sender performs the following steps:

1. Chooses a random integer \( k \)
2. Computes:
\[
C_1 = kP
\]
3. Computes:
\[
C_2 = M + kQ
\]

The ciphertext is the pair:
\[
(C_1,\; C_2)
\]

---

### 5.3 Decryption (Receiver Side)

The receiver, knowing the private key \( d \), computes:

\[
dC_1 = d(kP) = k(dP) = kQ
\]

The receiver then recovers the message by removing the mask:

\[
M = C_2 - dC_1
\]

Since:
\[
C_2 = M + kQ
\]

the masking term cancels out, and the original message is obtained.

---

### 5.4 Security Explanation

An attacker may know:
- \( P \)
- \( Q = dP \)
- \( C_1 = kP \)
- \( C_2 = M + kQ \)

But the attacker cannot compute \( kQ \) without solving the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem. Hence, decryption is infeasible without the private key.

---

## 6. Elliptic Curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH) Key Exchange

Elliptic Curve Diffie–Hellman is used for **secure key exchange**, not direct encryption.

### Step 1: Key Generation

- Alice chooses private key \( a \), computes public key \( A = aP \)
- Bob chooses private key \( b \), computes public key \( B = bP \)

---

### Step 2: Exchange of Public Keys

- Alice sends \( A \) to Bob
- Bob sends \( B \) to Alice

---

### Step 3: Shared Secret Computation

- Alice computes:
\[
S = aB = abP
\]
- Bob computes:
\[
S = bA = abP
\]

Both parties independently obtain the same shared secret without revealing their private keys.

This shared secret is then used to derive a symmetric encryption key.

## 7. Conceptual Progression for Understanding ECC

1. Points on an elliptic curve form a group
2. A generator point produces a cyclic subgroup
3. Scalar multiplication is efficient
4. Reversing scalar multiplication is infeasible (ECDLP)
5. Encryption hides data using this one-way operation
6. Diffie–Hellman enables secure key exchange

## Conclusion

Elliptic Curve Cryptography achieves strong security using relatively small key sizes by relying on the computational hardness of the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem and the algebraic structure of elliptic curve groups.
